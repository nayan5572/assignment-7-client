<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

## Add at least 3 project features?
1. Only 1 course can be selected from my course
2. And no one will get more than that in 20 minutes
3. I have many items in this course and the price is very low

## Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project
1. I first created a website layout.  Then created the json file.  And displayed the data on the website by calling the API from the json file.  Then I calculated the data by state declaration.  And I have created 4 states in the cart item.
